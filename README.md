CMB Metaboxes Foundation
========================

A foundation plugin that includes the fantastic Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress library on sites that require several implementations.

## What is this? ##

This is a small WordPress plugin that wraps and includes Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress.

## Why is this? ##

Because most of the time, I need to implement this library in several plugins on the same site.  I need a single place to include it, and I'd rather not put it in the theme.  This allows me to host a single, up to date copy in a lightweight plugin on said sites.
